1 - possible moves pre view:
- 









2 - time travell moves:
- 2  buttons
- < : sends request to move_back endpoint
- > : sends request to move_front endpoint
- define new variable in js called play_id : starts as None
- when clicking buttons, it sends play_id and expects response from endpoint to render board update
- endpoint returns at similarity to move endpoint the pos_i and pos_f of piece that moved
and gets rendered by render_updated_board() -> doesnt work for position where there was an eat.
solution - get al board an render it all

- problem : may only allow move once current_board is most updated board. otherwise complete chaos
- solution : can implement a button click counter that only when it returns to the initial state
(same clicks left as clicks right) it allows to move. otherwise move = False











3 - move rules (alternance between b/w) and points counting system:
